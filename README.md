## Belly-button biodiversity

This project utilizes html and JavaScript with plotly to represent data through an interactive webpage. The dataset involves the bacterial cultures found within the belly-buttons of volunteers, factoring in things like the frequency of washings per week of each subject. The dashboard allows the user to select among project volunteers, then to see which bacterial cultures were found for each sample, the relative number of each type, and the weekly washing frequency. These are visualized through a horizontal bar graph, a gauge chart, and a bubble chart. Interactive elements allow the user to quickly switch between different individual volunteers with the charts changing dynamically. Color coding and other html design elements are included to improve the user experience.
